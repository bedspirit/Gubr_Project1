# Gubr_Project1
This is the first part of a two-part improvement for a program called “The Gubr.”  The original Gubr was a command line program written in C++ that facilitates the management of inventory for a large corporation.  The Gubr filters a large dataset to a smaller dataset by allowing the user to exclude items that meet certain characteristics.  The original program was developed in 2019.
The planned improvement for the Gubr was to give it a GUI that would make it easier to use.  The structure of its data is to remain intact.  The second part of this improvement is to merge the interactivity featured from a 2022 version of the Gubr with the data structure of the original.

The contribution this project has on my ePortfolio is a demonstration of my familiarity with the software development lifecycle and as a display of a user-centric design.  It also showcases a preference for software that is fast, efficient, and pleasant to use.  Some of those qualities can be at odds with another.  The navigation of the development highlights my problem-solving skills and decision making.
I do feel like this part of the project meets the requirements for my planned enhancements.  There are some parts that I feel might benefit from further revision.  I had a desire to employ an overloaded function for this part of the project.  I hadn’t used that structure before but this project gave me an opportunity to employ it.  The GUI for this iteration of the Gubr features checkboxes for some of the most common elements for filtering.  I employed an overloaded function that changes slightly depending on the number of checkboxes that are present.  I am undecided about whether this structure is the most elegant.  It gives the code the flexibility to be easily updated.  For instance, adding another checkbox only requires the addition of another version of the same function and wouldn’t require any rewrites.  It can also make the code look overly long and repetitious.  I also wonder if the showcase of Windows Forms is a mistake for an ePortfolio.  Programs using Windows forms are not being developed as much as they once were.  Web-based frameworks are more common today and might be preferable to potential employers.  I plan to focus more on data analysis than software development so I don’t feel like the use of Windows Forms will be as impactful for me.
